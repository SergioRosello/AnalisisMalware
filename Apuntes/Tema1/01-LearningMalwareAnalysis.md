# Introduction to Malware Analysis

## Aprenderemos:

* What malware means and its role in the cyber-attacks
* Malware analysis and its significance in digital forensics
* Different types of malware analysis
* Setting up the lab environment
* Various sources to obtain malware samples

# What is Malware?

Malware is a code that performs malicious actions. 
It generally gets into your PC without wour consent and performs covert actions like:

* Disrupting computer operations
* Stealing sensitive information
* Unauthorized access to victim's system
* Spying on the victim
* Sending spam emails
* Engaging in DDOS attacks
* Ransomware

# Types of malware

* **Virus / worm:** Capable of spreading itself and copying to other computers (Virus needs human intervention, worm does not)
* **Trojan:** Malware that disguises itself as another program to trick users to install it in their system
* **Backdoor / RAT:** Trojan that enables the attacker to access infected computer
* **Adware:** Malware that presents unwanted ads to the user
* **Botnet:** Group of computers infected with the same malware waiting to recieve instructions from the command and control server
* **Information stealer:** Malware designed to steal sensitive data (Keyloggers, spyware, sniffers)
* **Ransomware:** Malware that holds the system on ransom by locking users out of the computer by encrypting files
* **Rootkit:** Malware that provides the attacker with priviledged access to the infected system
* **Downloader or dropper:** Malware designed to download additional malware components

# What is Malware Analysis?

The study of Malware's behavior.
The objective is to understand the working of malware and how to detect and eliminate it.

# Why Malware Analysis? 

To extract information from the malware sample, wich can help in responding to a malware incident.
The goal is to: Determine the capability of a Malware, detect it and contain it.

# Types of Malware Analysis

* **Static analysis:** Analysis of a binary without executing it
* **Dynamic analysis:** Executing suspected malware in a isolated environment and monitor it's behavior
* **Code analysis:** Advanced technique focused on analyzing the code to understand the inner workings of the binary
* **Memory analysis:** Analysis of the computer's RAM for forensic artifacts
